# House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniques
Kaggle Competition 

In my Machine Learning & Data Mining course at UC Irvine, I was required to write a report on a project I completed that showcased the skills and knowlegde learned in the course.  
The notebook I used in the House Prices competition on Kaggle, with a submission score of 0.12856, is included in the repository.
